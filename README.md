# Convolution Neural Networks for Image Recognition
This repository contains the assignment solution for the Stanford course [Convolution Neural Networks for visual recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/). 
For a beginner starting with neural networks and deep learning should definitely implement these assignments. It will give you a great 'feel' about some of the intricate concepts of neural nets like BackProp for example. 
## Assignment 1 
1.[knn.ipynb](Assignment1/knn.ipynb): contains an implementation of the nearest neighbour algorithm. One of the first algorithm in machine learning. It is later followed up by the generalised K nearest neighbour algorithm
1.[svm.ipynb](Assignment1/svm.ipynb): takes you through the svm classifier </br> 
1.[softmax.ipynb](Assignment1/softmax.ipynb): This assignment is more oriented towards softmax classifier. The advantage of the softmax classifier is a smooth and differentiable which is why it is advantageous over SVM
1.[two\_layer\_net.ipynb](Assignment1/two_layer_net.ipynb): This assignment walks through building a neural network(two layered) to build your initial classifier
