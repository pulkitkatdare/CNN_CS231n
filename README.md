# Convolution Neural Networks for Image Recognition
This repository contains the assignment solution for the Stanford course [Convolution Neural Networks for visual recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/). 
For a beginner starting with neural networks and deep learning should definitely implement these assignments. It will give you a great 'feel' about some of the intricate concepts of neural nets like BackProp for example. 
## Assignment 1 
[knn.ipynb](assignment1/knn.ipynb): contains an implementation of the nearest neighbour algorithm. One of the first algorithm in machine learning. It is later followed up by the generalised K nearest neighbour algorithm.
