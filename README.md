# Convolution Neural Networks for Image Recognition
This repository contains the assignment solution for the Stanford course [Convolution Neural Networks for visual recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/)
For a beginner starting with neural networks and deep learning should definitely implement these assignments. It will give you a great 'feel' about some of the intricate concepts of neural nets like BackProp for example.
